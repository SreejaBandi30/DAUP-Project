Project-1-ONLINE RETAIL DATA ANALYSIS(csv)
This project analyzes the Online Retail dataset through data cleaning, encoding, normalization, and outlier detection. We used visualizations like histograms and scatter plots to explore data patterns. Machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KNN—were applied to predict customer behavior, evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Logistic Regression improved with feature scaling, while Random Forest showed strong overall performance. The study highlights the value of preprocessing and model evaluation in gaining insights for e-commerce.

Project-2-EuroSAT Image Analysis (jPG)
This project used the EuroSAT dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in classifying satellite images into land cover types. CNNs achieved high accuracy, proving robust for high-dimensional image data. Fine-tuning and regularization were key to preventing overfitting. The results highlight CNNs' potential for remote sensing and environmental monitoring.

Project-3-MOVIE REVIEWS ANALYSIS (text)
This project showcases sentiment analysis on movie reviews using NLP and machine learning. After preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization, classifiers like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest were used, with SVM performing best. The results highlight the effectiveness of combining text processing with supervised learning for analyzing user-generated content.
